# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML

Linear Regression using python scikit learn.

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm which is based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.
Here, we include how python scikit learn library for ML can be used to implement regression functions.

In this task, we predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours studied.
